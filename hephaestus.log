[Main Context]
You are the 'Planejador Estratégico Avançado' do agente autônomo Hephaestus. Sua principal responsabilidade é identificar e propor o próximo objetivo de desenvolvimento mais impactante para a evolução do agente ou do projeto em análise.

[Decision Process for the Next Objective]
1.  **Analyze Code Metrics:** Review the `[CODE METRICS AND ANALYSIS]` section below. It contains data on file size (LOC), function size (LOC), cyclomatic complexity (CC) of functions, and modules that may be missing tests.
2.  **Consider the Project Manifest:** If the `[CURRENT PROJECT MANIFEST]` is provided, use it to understand the overall goals, architecture, and areas already documented or needing attention.
3.  **Review Recent History:** The `[HISTÓRICO RECENTE DO PROJETO E DO AGENTE]` section provides context on recent tasks, successes, and failures. Avoid repeating objectives that recently failed in the same way, unless the cause of failure has been resolved. Use history to build on successes.
4.  **Prioritize Structural and Quality Improvements:** Based on metrics, identify opportunities to:
    *   Refactor very large modules or very long/complex functions.
    *   Create tests for critical/complex modules or functions that lack them.
    *   Improve documentation (docstrings, manifest) where crucial.
    *   Propose the creation of new capabilities (new agents, tools) if the analysis indicates a strategic need.
5.  **Be Specific and Actionable:** The objective should be clear, concise, and indicate a concrete action.

[Examples of Smart and Self-Aware Objectives]
*   **Metrics-Based Refactoring:**
    *   "Refactor the module `agent/brain.py` (LOC: 350) which is extensive, considering splitting responsibilities into smaller modules (e.g., `agent/prompt_builder.py` or `agent/analysis_processor.py`)."
    *   "The function `generate_next_objective` in `agent/brain.py` (LOC: 85, CC: 12) is long and complex. Propose a plan to refactor it into smaller, more focused functions."
    *   "Analyze the most complex functions (CC > 10) listed in the metrics and select one for refactoring."
*   **Test Creation (Generate New Test Files):**
    *   "The module `agent/project_scanner.py` is missing a test file. Create a new test file `tests/agent/test_project_scanner.py` with basic unit tests for the `analyze_code_metrics` function."
    *   "Module `agent/memory.py` lacks tests. Generate `tests/agent/test_memory.py` and include placeholder tests for its public functions."
    *   "Create unit tests for the module `agent/tool_executor.py` in a new file `tests/agent/test_tool_executor.py`, focusing on the `web_search` function."
    *   "The function `call_llm_api` in `agent/utils/llm_client.py` is critical. Ensure robust unit tests exist for it in `tests/agent/utils/test_llm_client.py`, covering success and failure cases. If the test file doesn't exist, create it."
*   **Strategic Documentation Improvement:**
    *   "The manifest (`AGENTS.md`) does not describe the new metrics analysis functionality in `project_scanner.py`. Update it."
    *   "Improve docstrings for public functions in the `agent/memory.py` module to detail parameters and expected behavior."
*   **Development of New Capabilities (Agents/Tools):**
    *   "Create a new agent (e.g., `CodeQualityAgent` in `agent/agents.py`) dedicated to continuously monitoring code quality metrics and reporting regressions."
    *   "Develop a new tool in `agent/tool_executor.py` to automatically validate the syntax of JSON files before processing."
    *   "Propose a system for Hephaestus to evaluate the performance of its own operations and identify bottlenecks."
*   **Generic Objectives (when metrics/manifest are insufficient):**
    *   "Analyze the `agent/state.py` module to identify potential improvements in clarity or efficiency."
    *   "Review recent logs for frequent errors and propose an objective to fix them."

[Your Task]
Based on ALL the information provided (metrics, manifest, history), generate ONLY a single text string containing the NEXT STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE. The objective should be the most impactful and logical for the project's evolution at this moment.

        "refusal": null,
        "reasoning": "We are given code metrics and analysis, but no project manifest and no recent history.\n The code metrics highlight several large files, large functions, complex functions, and modules without tests.\n\n Priorities (from the instructions):\n   - Refactor very large modules or very long/complex functions.\n   - Create tests for critical/complex modules or functions that lack them.\n\n Among the large files, `agent/patch_applicator.py` is the largest (LOC: 697) and also has some of the most complex functions (e.g., `apply_patches` with CC:65 and LOC:285). Moreover, it is listed as a module without tests.\n\n Additionally, the function `apply_patches` in `agent/patch_applicator.py` is both very long (285 LOC) and highly complex (CC:65). This function is critical because it applies patches to the codebase, and any error here could lead to incorrect code changes.\n\n Given the critical nature of the patch applicator and the high complexity and size, it is a prime candidate for refactoring and testing.\n\n However, note that the module currently has no tests. Writing tests for such a complex function without refactoring might be very difficult. Therefore, a two-step approach might be needed: first refactor to make the code more testable, then write tests.\n\n But the instructions ask for a single next objective. We must choose the most impactful.\n\n Considering the risk of such a complex and critical module having no tests, the immediate priority should be to create tests. However, the complexity of the function might make writing tests challenging. Therefore, we might need to break down the function to make it testable.\n\n Alternatively, we can propose an objective that combines both: refactor the complex function to reduce its complexity and then write tests. But the instructions say to propose one objective.\n\n Let's look at the examples:\n\n   * \"Refactor the module ...\"\n   * \"Create unit tests for ...\"\n\n We can also propose a refactoring of a specific function and then note that tests should be written, but the objective must be one concrete action.\n\n Another candidate: `agent/cycle_runner.py` -> `run_cycles` (LOC:367, CC:77) is the most complex function in the list (CC:77) and also in a module without tests. This function is the core of the agent's execution cycle. Its complexity is extremely high, which is a risk.\n\n However, the `patch_applicator` is directly responsible for code changes and thus might be more critical for correctness.\n\n Alternatively, we might consider that without tests, any refactoring is risky. Therefore, writing tests first (even if they are high-level) might be a safer approach.\n\n But note: the module `agent/patch_applicator.py` has multiple complex functions. The entire module lacks tests.\n\n Given the above, I propose:\n\n   **Create tests for the `agent/patch_applicator.py` module.**\n\n However, because the module is large and complex, we might break it down by writing tests for one function at a time. But the objective should be to start testing.\n\n Alternatively, we can focus on the most critical function: `apply_patches`. \n\n Example from the examples: \n   \"Create unit tests for the module `agent/tool_executor.py` ... focusing on the `web_search` function.\"\n\n We can do similarly: focus on the `apply_patches` function.\n\n But note: the module has other complex functions that also need tests.\n\n Considering the impact, I think the most strategic objective is to start writing tests for the entire module, but we must be specific.\n\n However, the instructions say: \"Be Specific and Actionable\".\n\n Therefore, I propose:\n\n   \"Create a new test file `tests/agent/test_patch_applicator.py` with unit tests for the `apply_patches` function in `agent/patch_applicator.py`, covering its main use cases and edge cases.\"\n\n This is specific and actionable. It addresses a critical gap (no tests) for the most complex function in one of the largest modules.\n\n Why not refactor first? Because without tests, refactoring is risky. We want to have tests in place to ensure that refactoring does not break functionality.\n\n However, note that the function is very complex and might be hard to test. But we have to start somewhere.\n\n Alternatively, if we are concerned that the function is too complex to test, we might break it down first. But that would be a refactoring objective.\n\n After reevaluating, I think the most logical order is:\n   1. Write tests for the existing behavior (even if the function is complex, we can write high-level tests that cover the main scenarios).\n   2. Then refactor.\n\n Therefore, the next objective should be writing tests.\n\n Another candidate: `agent/cycle_runner.py` has the highest cyclomatic complexity function (`run_cycles` with CC:77) and also lacks tests. This is the core loop of the agent. It is equally critical.\n\n But note: `patch_applicator` is about code modification and if it fails, it can break the codebase. `cycle_runner` is about the control flow and if it fails, the agent stops. Both are critical.\n\n However, the `patch_applicator` is more directly related to code quality and correctness of changes. Also, it has the largest file size and the function `apply_patches` is the second longest function in the list (285 LOC) and the second most complex (CC:65). The `run_cycles` function is the longest (367 LOC) and most complex (CC:77). \n\n Given the metrics, both are critical. But we must choose one.\n\n Let me compare:\n\n   - `patch_applicator.py`: LOC 697 (largest file), and `apply_patches` is 285 LOC and CC 65.\n   - `cycle_runner.py`: LOC 387, and `run_cycles` is 367 LOC and CC 77.\n\n The function `run_cycles` is more complex and longer. However, the entire `cycle_runner` module is smaller than `patch_applicator`.\n\n Considering the impact, I think both are top priorities. But the instructions say \"the most impactful\".\n\n Since `patch_applicator` is responsible for applying changes to the code, and without tests we risk introducing bugs in the codebase, I lean towards `patch_applicator`.\n\n However, note that the `run_cycles` function is the heart of the agent. If it fails, the agent doesn't work. So it's also critical.\n\n But without tests for `patch_applicator`, we might be applying incorrect patches and then the agent's work is flawed. So I think `patch_applicator` is slightly more critical for the correctness of the output.\n\n Therefore, I stick with the objective for `patch_applicator`.\n\n However, let me see if there is a module that is both large and without tests and has high complexity that we haven't considered. The `brain.py` module is also large (395 LOC) and has complex functions (e.g., `generate_next_objective` with CC:32 and LOC:187) and no tests. But `brain.py` is about generating objectives, which is important but not as critical as applying patches correctly or running the main cycle.\n\n Final decision:\n\n   Create tests for the `apply_patches` function in `agent/patch_applicator.py`.\n\n Objective string:\n\n   \"Create a new test file `tests/agent/test_patch_applicator.py` with unit tests for the `apply_patches` function in `agent/patch_applicator.py`, covering its main use cases and edge cases.\"\n\n But note: the module has other functions that are also complex and long (like `_handle_replace` and `_handle_delete_block`). However, the objective can start with the main function.\n\n Alternatively, we can write tests for the entire module. But the example objectives focus on specific functions when starting.\n\n Since the instructions say \"be concise\", we can write:\n\n   \"Create unit tests for the `apply_patches` function in `agent/patch_applicator.py` in a new test file `tests/agent/test_patch_applicator.py`.\"\n\n But to be more complete, we can say:\n\n   \"Create a new test file `tests/agent/test_patch_applicator.py` and write unit tests for the `apply_patches` function in `agent/patch_applicator.py`, covering its main use cases and edge cases.\"\n\n This is specific and actionable.\n\n However, note that the function is very complex (CC:65). We might not cover all edge cases at once, but we can start with the main ones.\n\n Alternatively, we might break down the testing into multiple objectives, but again, one objective at a time.\n\n Therefore, I propose this as the next strategic objective.\n"
