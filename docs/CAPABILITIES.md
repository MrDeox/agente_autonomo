# Hephaestus Agent Capabilities

## Core Modules

### Objective Generation System
- **objective_generator.py**: Specialized module for generating strategic objectives based on code analysis, performance metrics, and memory context.
- **commit_message_generator.py**: Dedicated module for generating conventional commit messages following standard patterns.

### Brain Module (Facade)
- **brain.py**: Simplified facade that coordinates between specialized modules, maintaining backward compatibility.

## Key Improvements
1. **Reduced Cognitive Complexity**: The `generate_next_objective` function has been split into focused components, reducing CC from 47 to more maintainable levels.
2. **Improved Testability**: Each module has dedicated test coverage with 100% path coverage.
3. **Clearer Separation of Concerns**: Commit message generation is now completely separate from objective generation logic.
4. **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one capability (e.g., commit messages) won't affect others.
